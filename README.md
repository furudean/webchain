# webchain

webchain is a decentralized [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring),
where each member website can nominate others, creating a walkable graph
of trust.

This repository contains code for a [crawler](scraper) that can discover the webchain
and output it in different formats, and a [visualizer webpage](web) to inspect the
current state of a webchain.

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the specification.
